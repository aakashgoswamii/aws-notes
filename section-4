**Multi Factor Authentication -MFA**
---Users have access to the account and they can change the configurations or delete resources.
---So we need to protect our **Root Accounts** and **IAM users**.
---MFA = Pass + security device you own.
---Its benefit is that even if password is stolen or hacked ,the account is not compromised.
**MFA Devices options in AWS**
--Virtual MFA device .eg Google Authenticator(phone only) and Authy (multi-device).
--Universal 2nd factor security key. eg. YubiKey.

**AWS CLOUDSHELL**
  -- ls : this command list out all the files in your cloud shell.
  -- echo "test" > demo.txt : This will create a txt file which contains data "test".
